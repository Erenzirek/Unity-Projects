### Use of PlayerPrefs in `LevelManager` Script

In the **`LevelManager`** script, we use **`PlayerPrefs`** to manage the progression of the levels the player has unlocked. Here is an explanation of how **`PlayerPrefs`** is used:

````csharp
int levelsUnlocked = PlayerPrefs.GetInt("levelsUnlocked", 1);
Debug.Log("Levels Unlocked: " + levelsUnlocked);
